<h1> Adopt a Panda </h1>
<p class="uno"> Giant pandas are found only in the temperate forests of China. Although classified as a carnivore, the
  panda’s diet consists almost exclusively of bamboo. Despite being one of the most popular animals in the world, giant
  pandas are threatened by habitat fragmentation and unsustainable development. It is estimated that 1,800 pandas remain
  in the wild. WWF is the primary international conservation organization protecting pandas and their habitat. </p>
<p class="dos">When WWF was first founded in 1961, a giant panda living at the London Zoo inspired our simple black and
  white logo—an icon that has since evolved into a rallying symbol of global conservation.

  Today, WWF protects wild pandas by preventing habitat loss caused by human development and encroachment, the most
  serious threat to their long-term survival. For years, led by WWF-China and now with new partners including
  Disneynature, we’ve worked to preserve and link important panda corridors across China, spanning more than 34 million
  acres, three provinces, and two of the country’s largest river basins. In the process, we’ve protected critical
  habitat for other species too: snub-nosed monkeys, takins, and snow leopards among them.

  The efforts are yielding success: Wild panda numbers are finally rebounding after years of decline. In September, the
  International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) announced that pandas have been upgraded from “endangered” to
  “vulnerable” on the global list of species at risk of extinction, following a population growth of nearly 17% over the
  past decade.

  Yet while this recent status change for pandas is encouraging, they’re not out of the woods yet. Says Lo Sze Ping, CEO
  of WWF-China, “Everyone should celebrate this achievement. But pandas remain scattered and vulnerable, and much of
  their habitat is threatened by poorly planned infrastructure projects. Remember, there are still only 1,864 left in
  the wild.”

  The photo above is from Disneynature's upcoming film Born in China. A portion of opening-week ticket sales in the US
  and China will benefit WWF's panda conservation efforts.</p>

      <h2>How can we help save the panda?</h2>
      <p>While the panda's future remains precarious, its numbers are slowly increasing in the wild. There are now more panda reserves than ever before and more projects to help people sustainably coexist with them.
    
        This is all thanks to the efforts of the Chinese authorities and local communities, and the support of WWF and people like you!</p>
